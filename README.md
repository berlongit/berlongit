<h2>Fun Facts</h2>

- <b>...In 1967, during a match between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United, a dog ran onto the field and, to the amusement of the crowd, promptly stole the ball. The players and officials had quite a time trying to catch the playful pup and retrieve the ball, adding an unexpected twist to the game!</b>
